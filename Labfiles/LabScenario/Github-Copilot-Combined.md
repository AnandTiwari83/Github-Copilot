# Lab Scenario Preview: Github-Copilot

## Lab Overview

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that accelerates code writing using OpenAI Codex. It suggests lines and functions based on context from comments and code, compatible with various editors. Trained on multiple languages, suggestions' quality depends on data diversity. Copilot aids GitHub code refactoring, enhancing code quality without altering behavior. It streamlines test-driven development by auto-generating comprehensive unit tests. The tool promotes best practices, including chat-based interaction, auto-comments, and documentation. Regular updates and efficient code discovery optimize Copilot's benefits. GitHub Copilot Chat provides coding assistance within supported IDEs. GitHub Codespaces with Copilot integrates cloud-based development for a seamless coding experience.
