1. Paste the following comment and click on **Enter** and verify the next comment is generated by **Github Copilot**.

   ```
   # write 'hello world' to the console
   ```

### Task 3: Creating the game logic

1. Paste the following **comment (1)** to fetch the code and click on Make request **(Enter) (2)** button and click on **Accept (3)** to use the code. If you want to regenerate the code, click on **Regenerate (4)** option.

   ```
    The player can choose rock, paper, or scissors, and invalid inputs are handled gracefully. After each round, display whether the player won, lost, or tied. Allow the player to play again after each round and display their score at the end of the game. Inputs are converted to lowercase for consistency.
   ```
